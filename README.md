# MapGenerator
This is my personal project created to randomly generate a 2D grid map.
The user should be able to do the following:
  1. Specify the size of the map.
  2. Sepcify the obstacle rate of the map.
  
More this program will be enriched in the future, e.g. add certain shapes to the map, add a visualizer.
The map generated will be following the format of [.map](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html) file.

Any suggestions would be appreciated :)
