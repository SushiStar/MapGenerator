# MapGenerator
This is my personal project created to randomly generate a 2D grid map.
The user should be able to do the following:
  1. Specify the size of the map.
  2. Sepcify the obstacle rate of the map.
  
The map generated will be following the format of [.map](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html) file.

Any suggestions would be appreciated :)
